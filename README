Usage: "./pnms2pdf" <PAGE SIZE> <pnm file> [[pnm file], [pnm file]...]

I make a multi-page PDF from the input pnm files and write the result to
standard output (so you should redirect me with >"combined.pdf". I do this in
an insecure fashion so you should only run me from within a directory that
only you have read and write access to (on most systems, your home directory
defaults to those permissions so don't worry about it too much if you don't
understand).

I only know the following page sizes (more will be added on request):

A4, A5, Letter

You can also specify your own special page format like this:

12345.12:12345.12 where the sizes are in millimeters.

This program was originally written to speed up conversion to PDF of a
multi-file xsane project. You can use it in this fashion by changing to your
multi-project directory and issuing the command:

"./pnms2pdf" A5 `awk 'NR > 1' xsane-multipage-list` >combined.pdf

Where A5 was my page size, and the awk command in backticks generates a page
list from the xsane project file by skipping the first line and supplying the
rest as arguments.
